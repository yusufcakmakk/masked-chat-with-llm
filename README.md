## Chat with your documents and keep your confidential data while using cloud LLM providers.

When developing chatbot applications, confidential information is crucial for customer privacy. So if you want to use cloud-based LLMs like GPT4 (OpenAI), you need to find a solution for keeping those fields before sending them to the LLM provider.
